# Safe-Than-Sorry-Safety-Quiz-and-Scenarios
Safety quiz that tests users' knowledge about cybersecurity, hand-washing skills, suicide prevention, and CPR/First Aid topics. 


This project is a basic safety quiz called “Safe Than Sorry” that covers cybersecurity, hand-washing skills, suicide prevention, and CPR/First Aid topics through simple questions and thoughtful scenarios. The title of this program is based on the saying, “better safe than sorry”, which encompasses a cautious way of thinking that prioritizes safe practices and caution. This program can be used in any workplace as a training test module to be completed by staff members or for extracurricular activities. 

Cybersecurity, hand-washing skills, and suicide prevention are all vital aspects of public and personal safety that communities can benefit from refreshing and testing their knowledge on. It is important to note that the CPR section includes adults, children, infants, and pets, which helps extend this program's usage to regular workplaces, healthcare, and veterinary use. The cybersecurity section will highlight suspicious signs to be aware of and different plans of action for suspicious emails and contacts. The hand washing will focus on techniques and washing etiquette to stop the spread of germs and sicknesses. Lastly, the suicide prevention options will touch on different types of helpful responses and psychological terms.
